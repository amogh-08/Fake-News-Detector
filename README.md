### Novelty : <br> ###
There has been a rapid increase in the spread of fake news in the last decade, most prominently observed in the 2016 US elections. Such proliferation of sharing articles online that do not conform to facts has led to many problems not just limited to politics but covering various other domains such as sports, health, and also science. One such area affected by fake news is the financial markets, where a rumor can have disastrous consequences and may bring the market to a halt.

Our ability to take a decision relies mostly on the type of information we consume; our world view is shaped on the basis of information we digest. There is increasing evidence that consumers have reacted absurdly to news that later proved to be fake. One recent case is the spread of novel corona virus, where fake reports spread over the Internet about the origin, nature, and behavior of the virus. The situation worsened as more people read about the fake contents online. Identifying such news online is a daunting task.
